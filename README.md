# CPSC210 Project - Restaurant Tracker & Recommender

## Introduction

### Functions
The proposed application allows the user to keep track of a 'to-eat' list of restaurants and suggests a random one from the pool each time the user prompts for one. It will also have a rating function. 

### Motivations
It is sometimes difficult to keep track of the number of options for lunch or supper, especially when pressed for time. The app aims to give users a tool to record ratings on restaurants and get suggestions from a user-defined list. 

## User stories

- As a user, I want to be able to be able to view all restaurants in my list
- As a user, I want to be able to add individual restaurants, or a collection of restaurants to my personal list
- As a user, I want to receive a random restaurant suggestion from the list when prompting for one
- As a user, I want to be able to give individual restaurants a rating on a scale of one to five
