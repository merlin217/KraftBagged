# 'KraftBagged' - Restaurant Tracker & Recommender

## Introduction

'KraftBagged' is inspired by 'LetterBoxd'. Whereas 'LetterBoxd' provides a platform to rate movies and create to-watch lists, 'KraftBagged' allows users to rate restaurants and manage to-eat lists. 

### Functions
The application allows the user to keep track of a 'to-eat' list of restaurants and suggests a random one from the pool each time the user prompts for one. It will allow users to rate restaurants and update their ratings. 

### Motivations
It is sometimes difficult to keep track of the number of options for lunch or supper, especially when you don't have a lot of time. The app aims to give users a tool to record ratings on restaurants and get suggestions from a user-defined list. 

## User stories

- As a user, I want to be able to be able to view all restaurants in my list
- As a user, I want to be able to add individual restaurants, or a collection of restaurants to my personal list
- As a user, I want to receive a random restaurant suggestion from the list when prompting for one
- As a user, I want to be able to give individual restaurants a rating on a scale of one to five
- As a user, I want to be able to save my lists and ratings (current profile) from the main menu
- As a returning user (someone who has entered the same username in a previously saved session), I want to be able to load my data when starting up the application.
